> Description: What could possibly be hidden inside a diving logbook? author: Skipper|RedRocket

Running the elf, it asks us for the name of a diver:

```shell
$ ./rev 
| >>> REEF RANGERS Dive Panel <<< |
| ------------------------------- |
|    Please provide Diver Name:   |

```
Not knowing them we can launch `strings` on the executable and see what we can find:

```shell
$ strings ./rev 
[...]

```

The flag appears to be there, but it won't work if we try to submit it. however, we also find names of the divers.
Opening the executable in Ghidra we immediately notice that it's a cpp executable. The `main()` function, looks a bit confusing but we notice that there's a call to an interesting `door_lock()` function following an if statement. After a couple of attempts we discover that the diver triggering that function is `Jeremy`.
Looking more closely at the `door_lock()` function, we know that it takes `param_1` as input and does the following check:

```c
if (param_1 * 2 >> 8 == 0x539) {
```

Right-shifting a number of `n` bits also means that it's being divided by 2 to the power of `n`.

```python
In [1]: (0x539 * (2**8)) / 2
Out[1]: 171136.0
```
Or
```python
In [2]: (0x539 << 8) / 2
Out[2]: 171136.0
```

Will get us the magic number.

```shell
$ ./rev   
| >>> REEF RANGERS Dive Panel <<< |
| ------------------------------- |
|    Please provide Diver Name:   |
